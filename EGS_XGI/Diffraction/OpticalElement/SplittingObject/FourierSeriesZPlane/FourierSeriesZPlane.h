/*A class to simulate phase gratings.
  Splits incoming paths into paths according to the Fourier series of the
  transmission function. The argument of the Fourier coefficients gives the
  change of direction of the path.

  Has modes selected by the boolean member variables:
  - 'm_bIncludeAttenuationInGrating'
	->Switches on $Exp[-\mu * d / 2]$-terms in the transmission function,
	   where $\mu$ denotes the attenuation coefficient and d the grating
	   thickness.
  - 'm_bDirectionCorrectionGratingThickness'
	->Switches on a correction factor 'fDirectionCorrection' for the grating
	  thickness. 'fDirectionCorrection' = $1.0 / (\hat{p}\hat{n})$, where $\hat{p}$
	  denotes the direction of the momentum vector and $\hat{n}$ the normal
	  vector on the grating, both with unit length :
	  $\left|\hat{p}\right| = \left|\hat{n}\right| = 1$. In the case of a
	  flat grating 'fDirectionCorrection' = 1.0/the_stack->w[.].
  The two functionalities are independent of each other.
  Energy dependence of the phase shift is aways taken into account.

  The Fourier series is split into two parts an energy independent part
  $sin(n\pi 'm_fDutyCycle')/(n\pi)$ done in InitOpticalElement, an energy dependent
  part $\tau_a -\tau_b$ (done in StartRayTracing()) and a spatially dependent phase
  shift $Exp[-iQx_1]$, where $x_1$ is the x-position in the grating plane, calculated
  in ApplyOpticalElementRule().
  If 'm_bDirectionCorrectionGratingThickness' is set to false the Fourier series only
  has to be calculated once for each "incoherent history" (i.e. indistinguishable
  alternatives don't require a recalculation of the Fourier series).
